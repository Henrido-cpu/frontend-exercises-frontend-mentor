## My process

I started by inspecting the design and thought about ways of approaching things and i ended up with going with a container div aka the card in this case and using it as a flexbox. I also used vw unit for many elements because i thought it could be more responsive that way, it didnt really end up exactly the way i intended it to, but i thought its good enough for this purpose. I intend to get as much hands on practise as possible and not focus on pixel perfecting practise designs.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how rusty i am with centering divs etc. many things kinda fell out of place and i had some frustrating problems, but i got to a point where i am happy with the end result.

### Continued development

I am definitely refining my skills, before coming back to these projects and patiently go throught the odin projects foundations. I am also definitely coming back to this project in the future to make the code more clean and professional, when i have the skillset for it.
